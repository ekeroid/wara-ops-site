                  <p class="lead">Another new call for funding related to the WARAs (including WARA-Ops) has been launched!  This is funded by WASP Sweden and Vinnova. The call offers funding for collaboration projects between industry and WASP academics, with expected outcomes being “the formulation of questions about future research challenges and plans for continued collaboration”. For more information please see <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/calls/call-for-research-validation-projects-in-wasp-research-arenas/">the call website.</a> The project should involve one of the WASP research arenas – such as your favourite one, WARA-Ops.  If you come up with a proposal with an industrial partner, we’re happy to work with you to supply a letter of intent – just let us know.  In the case of Ops, you want to be thinking around use of operational data – this could be stream processing, anomaly detection, log analysis, predictive analytics for operational management, etc. Please contact <a href="mailto:paul.townend@umu.se">Paul Townend</a> or <a href="mailto:johan.eker@control.lth.se">Johan Eker</a> for more information.

                    "<em>Presentation introduces an HVAC System (plus mentions connections to other technical systems in the building i.e. Fire and Access Control) on an architectural level.

                <p class="lead" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://play.umu.se/media/t/0_mcin9rpf">Watch a video that introduces and explains WARA-Ops by clicking here</a></p>    
                
                <p class="lead">Ops is an ambitious research arena that seeks to bring together Swedish industry and academia to solve state-of-the-art challenges in data-driven operational research. It will develop an advanced data storage and processing infrastructure that will enable users to interactively store, annotate, process, and visualize large operational datasets, and - importantly - will provide a collaborative environment that will allow users to interact, share data and results, and set challenges and research questions. Ops aims to actively enable and encourage a significant increase in research collaborations between WASP community members, through a unique national resource.</p>
    
                <p class="lead">The initial focus of WARA-Ops will be in two key areas:</p>

                <ul class="lead">
                    <li style="margin-left:50px;">Anomaly detection. We will collect and provide datasets and their associated research challenges, e.g., intrusion detection, denial-of-service attacks, etc. Examples of data include system/software log files, lists of access requests, etc.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left:50px; margin-top:10px">Autonomous management. We provide and generate datasets that can be used to drive research into next-generation autonomous management systems that can proactively predict future demand, detect, and react to changes in user/network/hardware behaviour, etc. Examples includes power reduction use metrics that such as CPU/Disk/Network/Memory usage over time, power consumption data.</li>
                </ul>
                    
                <p class="lead">The above research results are applicable across a wide set of application domains, including most online services, communication systems, automation services, energy management, financial and bank systems, online retail, and cloud/edge data centres. The application areas also include software build systems and CI/CD-pipelines. With a strong focus on data storage and cataloging, combined with the provision of a scalable CPUbased environment for interactive data querying, processing, and visualisation, Ops is a natural complement to the Berzelius service (which focuses on GPU-intensive AI/ML workloads). The project is a continuation of WARA-Common - it will be professionally managed by Ericsson Research and significantly extends the current service. Additionally, Ops will include access to a live 5G network and full-scale cloud service, plus access to the monitoring data they generate. In addition to data generated within the Ops arena, the ambition is to also solicit data set through our partner network.</p>
                <p class="lead">The expected research outputs of Ops are data collection tools (including scalable storage, cataloging, and annotation services), methods for online processing (including auto-scaling resources for interactive data queries, filtering, and visualisation), a collaborative environment to facilitate interaction between researchers and partners (including ability to set research challenges on datasets, allow commenting and communication across researchers, etc.), and ultimately self-learning anomaly detection mechanisms, root cause analysis strategies, and system theory for the control of large-scale systems.
